# SpotiClone-A-Vanilla-CSS-and-HTML-Spotify-Clone
SpotiClone is a project aimed at replicating the user interface of Spotify's web application using only HTML and CSS without any external frameworks or libraries. The project will involve creating a homepage layout similar to Spotify's, including features such as a navigation bar, hero section, featured playlists, and a footer.
